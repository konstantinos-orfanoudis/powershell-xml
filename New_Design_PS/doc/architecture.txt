Adapters

Each adapter parses a source (OpenAPI, WSDL, GraphQL, etc.) and emits a
CanonicalSchema (entities + fields with canonical types).

Normalizer

Maps source-specific types to canonical types (String, Integer, Number, Boolean,
Date, DateTime, Enum, Array, Object).

Merger

Unifies multiple CanonicalSchemas, dedupes entities/fields, resolves conflicts.

Inference (Optional)

Suggests better names, IDs, enums, descriptions. Always human-in-the-loop.

Validator

Quality gates: at least one entity, no empty entities, reasonable typing, etc.

Exporter

Writes the final schema.json in your connector format.
